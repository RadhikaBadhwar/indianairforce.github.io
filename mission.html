<div><font size=4><i><b>Each and every one of us must clearly know the Mission of the 
Indian air force and direct all our resources, energies, capabilities and potential 
towards Mission accomplishment. We must be prepared to perform beyond the call of duty 
and look after those placed below us while doing so. only then can we achieve our Mission
 with integrity and excellence.</div>

<center><h2><b><u><font color=red>EXCELLENCE:</font></b></u></h3></center>
<div><font size=4><i><b>Excellence is giving our best in whatever we do. excellence is achieved by combining 
knowledge, skill and training into a powerful value that allows us to contribute effectively 
in whatever we do. excellence is contagious and spreads rapidly. so share excellence and become
a mentor and a leader. excellence in the cockpit, on the tarmac, and in the office must become 
a way of life. it will drive us to achieve extraordinary things for the iaf and ourselves.</div>

<center><h2><b><u><font color=red>INTEGRITY:</font></u></b></h3></center>
<div><font size=4><i><b>Simply put, integrity is the character trait of doing the right thing always and every time, 
whether anyone is watching or not. it is like our moral compass that guides us in times of trouble 
and keeps a check on us when the going is good. integrity is courage, honesty, responsibility, 
accountability, humility, all rolled into one solid character trait that will allow us to stand out as
a ‘model’ air Warrior. do remember that if we display integrity, we will be trusted by both our seniors
and juniors.When we are trusted, we will be inspired to perform well beyond your capability, and when we 
perform beyond our capability, we bring honour to our service, unit & ourselves.</div>
<br><br>
<p>Our value: integrity in whatever we do.</p></b></i></font>
