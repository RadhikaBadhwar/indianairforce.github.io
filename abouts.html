      <font size=6 Color="navy"><br>The Indian Air Force (Bharatiya Vayu Sena) is the air arm of the Indian armed forces.
Its complement of peronnel and aircraft assets ranks fourth amongst the airforces of the world.
 Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict.
It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honored India's aviation service during World War II with the prefix Royal.
 After India gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India.
 With the government's transition to a Republic in 1950, the prefix Royal was removed after only three years.</font>
